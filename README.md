   - Utilizes the `speedtest` module to fetch download and upload speeds as well as ping latency.
   - Displays the results in a human-readable format.

3. **Text from image.py**:
   - Extracts text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.
   - Relies on the pytesseract library, which is a wrapper for the Tesseract OCR engine.
   - Supports various image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG) and languages.

4. **Text to Speech.py**:
   - Converts text input into speech output using the pyttsx3 library.
   - Provides options to adjust speech properties such as rate and volume.
   - Supports multiple voices and languages.

5. **Speech to Text.py**:
   - Transcribes spoken words into text using the SpeechRecognition library.
   - Utilizes the Google Web Speech API for accurate speech recognition.
   - Handles various audio formats and noise conditions.

6. **Screen Recorder.py**:
   - Captures the screen in real-time and records it into a video file using PyAutoGUI and OpenCV.
   - Allows users to specify the region of the screen to record.
   - Provides options to set frame rate and video format.

7. **URL Shortener.py**:
   - Shortens URLs using a custom algorithm and provides a service to redirect users from shortened URLs to original ones.
   - Implements a simple HTTP server to handle redirection requests.
   - Supports custom short URL formats and analytics tracking.

8. **Python analog watch.py**:
   - Displays an analog clock using the Turtle graphics library.
   - Shows the current time with hour, minute, and second hands.
   - Supports customization of clock face color, size, and style.

9. **ScreenShooter.py**:
   - Captures screenshots of the entire screen or a specific region using PyAutoGUI.
   - Saves screenshots to the specified directory with customizable file names.

10. **To Do.py**:
    - Manages a to-do list allowing users to add, delete, and view tasks.
    - Stores tasks in a simple text file format for persistence.
    - Provides options to mark tasks as completed and clear the entire list.
